## Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a system to automatically detect the Lupus Butterfly Malar Rash (BMR).  BMR is a major Lupus indicator that is classifed as a reddish facial rash that appears symmetrically in the cheeks and the back of the nose.  A database will be created with images manually collected from the social networks and the internet through searches of "butterfly rash."  The algorithm will be programmed through training of a large dataset.
